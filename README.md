Starting Your Project with Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App.

Available Commands
Once you're in your project folder, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
This command runs your application in development mode.


The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes.
Any errors or warnings will appear in the console.

npm test
This command starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more details, check out the running tests documentation.

npm run build
This command creates an optimized production build of your app in the build directory.
React is bundled and optimized for best performance in production.

The build process also minifies your code and assigns hashed filenames to ensure long-term caching.
After running this command, your app will be ready for deployment.

For more details, refer to the deployment documentation.

npm run eject
Warning: This action is irreversible. Once you eject, it cannot be undone.

If you ever need full control over the configuration (such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can use npm run eject. This will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing you to modify them. However, this process removes the simplicity that Create React App provides.

You donâ€™t need to eject unless you have specific requirements. Most users will find the default setup suitable for their needs.
